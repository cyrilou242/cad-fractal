# cad-fractal
Python generated openscad code of fractal 
Project not in active development but may be one day. Used as a hello world.

need to rewrite all the code like fractal(n,f) where n : number of iterations (depth) and f : designing function
with rules on f definition, whould be easy for everyone to write f's and then throw the through the fractal function

#### Really have no time for this project but might get back in when getting a 3D-Printer
